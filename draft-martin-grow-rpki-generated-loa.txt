         Generating a Letter of Agency to reflect RPKI Validity
              draft-martin-grow-rpki-generated-loa-latest

Abstract

   Letters of Agency (LOA) are commonly used to authorise network
   providers to accept and propagate routing information received from
   others.  The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) can be used to
   perform a similar function, with the advantage that RPKI-signed
   objects can be validated automatically and in a more robust manner
   than manual processing of documents.  However, some network operators
   have established processes that expect and require LOAs to be
   exchanged, despite their limitations.  This document proposes a
   format for constructing a LOA in the case where RPKI validation is
   available, with the goal of enabling a transition to a future where
   LOAs are no longer needed.

1.  Introduction

   Some organisations use IP addresses that have been assigned or
   allocated for their use and that are independent of any particular
   network service provider.  For such address space to be reachable on
   the global Internet, routing information must be proagated from one
   or more originating autonomous systems and must be received by other
   adjacent or further distant autonomous systems in order for traffic
   directed at those addresses to be sent in the right direction.

   It is best current practice for network operators not to accept
   routing information from adjacent networks indiscriminately, but
   rather to filter routing information to ensure that Internet traffic
   is not routed inappropriately.  Network operators are expected to
   accept routing information selectively, filtering and allowing only
   route advertisements that they have reason to believe are legitimate.

   In the case of routing information that is being received directly
   from a customer network, or is being originated by the network
   provider on the customer's behalf, such legitimacy has often been
   determined by the customer issuing a Letter of Agency (LOA), a
   document that provides authorisation for one operator to act on
   behalf of another.  Such letters are commonly exchanged in the form
   of electronic documents exchanged over insecure mechanisms like
   e-mail with no integrity protection or strong authentication.  For
   more discussion about LOAs, see Appendix A.  Some limitations of this
   practice are discussed briefly in Section 6.

   The RPKI provides an opportunity to provide equivalent authorisation
   to a Letter of Agency in a form that is independently verifiable and
   cryptographically strong.  However, many network operators have
   established workflows that include LOAs, and at the time of writing
   many customers are not practised in the management of RPKI-signed
   objects.

   This document describes a template for constructing a Letter of
   Agency in the case where RPKI verification of a request to exchange
   routing informationi is possible.  We propose that network operators
   accept such documents, with corresponding crypytographic validation
   of associated signed objects, in place of a conventional LOA.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  RPKI Authorisation of Routing Data

   Suppose a customer requests that a network provide connectivity for
   their addresses, represented by an IP prefix.  The provider is
   requested to either originate or accept the prefix from the
   customer's network using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC4271].
   The prefix will propagate from the provider's network with the
   AS_PATH attribute "... P+ C*" where P is the provider's Autonomous
   System Number (ASN), C is the customer's ASN, + denotes one or more
   repetitions and * denotes zero or more repetitions.

   For example, a customer with ASN C who advertises prefix A to the
   provider's ASN P might intend that the prefix propagates to adjacent
   networks of the provider with the AS_PATH "... P C".  A different
   customer who directs the provider to originate prefix B on their
   behalf might intend that the prefix propagates to adjacent networks
   of the provider with the AS_PATH "... P".

   The RPKI can be used to sign and publish objects that reflect these
   intentions.  The two object types used for this purpose are the Route
   Origin Authorization (ROA) and Autonomous System Provider
   Authorization (ASPA) objects.

3.1.  Route Origin Authorization (ROA) Objects

   ROAs are described in [RFC9582].  A valid ROA provides authorisation
   for a particular set of prefixes to be originated from a particular
   ASN.

   In the examples above, a signed ROA might authorise prefix A to be
   originated from ASN C, and another signed ROA might authorise prefix
   B to be originated from ASN P.

3.2.  Autonomous System Proider Authorization (ASPA) Objects

   ASPAs are described in [I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile].  A valid ASPA
   provides authorization for a particular prefix to propagate along
   particular edges in a graph of connected autonomous systems.

   In the examples above, a signed ASPA might authorise prefix A to
   exhibit the AS_PATH "... P C".

4.  Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP) Considerations

   Originating routes on behalf of customers has long been a common
   function of network operators.  At the time of writing it is also
   common for other types of provider, e.g. those that provide services
   such as content distribution or cloud compute.  Such service
   providers sometimes use the phrase "Bring Your Own IP" (BYOIP) to
   describe the practice of using customer-supplied addresses to make
   services available on behalf of those customers.

   The provider may have many distinct and unrelated customers.  A
   customer who authorises the provider to attach their BYOIP prefixes
   to their account does not normally authorise the use of those
   prefixes by other customers.  In order to ensure that a particular
   BYOIP prefix is attached to an account that is authorised to use it,
   a provider requires further authorisation from the customer.

   [RFC9323] provides a profile for RPKI Signed Checklists (RSCs) which
   can be used by a resource holder as an attestation.

   In the case of the examples in {authorisation}, the customer
   responsible for BYOIP prefix A might sign an attestation that
   authorises the use of that prefix with their account and make that
   attestation available to the provider.  The attestion might be signed
   with the ROA or the ASPA associated with prefix A.  Similarly, the
   customer responsible for BYOIP prefix B might sign a checklist
   authorising using the ROA associated with prefix B.

   Authorisation of particular BYOIP prefixes to be attached to
   particular provider accounts is necessarily provider-specific.  Other
   mechanisms are possible.

5.  Constructing a LOA based on RPKI Validation

   A LOA constructed according to this specification is referred to as
   an RPKI Letter of Agency (RPKI LOA).

   An RPKI LOA is intended to be a human-readable representation of
   validation that can be performed by automated systems.  Consequently,
   there is no benefit in an RPKI LOA being machine-readable.  Automatic
   verification of authorisation to originate or propagate a prefix
   SHOULD use RPKI-signed objects and perform signature validation
   directly and SHOULD NOT attempt to process the contents of an RPKI
   LOA.

   This document specifies an ordering and a list of details that MUST
   be included in a LOA for it to be consistent with this specification,
   but provides few normative requirements for presentation or precise
   wording.  This is intended to provide sufficient consistency for the
   LOA to be clear and familiar while leaving flexibility for providers
   to be able to include additional information and adopt a style that
   suits their particular circumstances.

   This section describes a number of sections, all of which MUST be
   included in an RPKI LOA.  Some sections specify text to be included
   verbatim, while other sections describe the information to be
   included without prescribing particular text.

   Where this specification requires particular text to be included
   verbatim, that text MUST be included in English.  RPKI LOAs MAY also
   include translations of that normative text in other languages.  All
   other parts of an RPKI ROA MAY use any languages or scripts.

   Each of the following sections MUST be separated so that they can
   easily be distinguished from each other.  Each section MAY include a
   section heading.

5.1.  Introduction

   This section MUST begin with the following text, included verbatim:

   "This is an RPKI LOA that conforms to (this document)."

   This section MAY also include other introductory information, such as
   useful external references or information about the resource holder.

5.2.  Provenance and Validity

   The name and contact details of the person or organisation issuing
   the RPKI LOA should be included.

   The date at which the RPKI LOA was prepared should be included.

5.3.  Route Origination and Service Provider Authorisation

   This section MUST begin with the following text, included verbatim:

   "The following route originations have been authorised by the
   publication of RPKI-signed ROA and/or ASPA objects.  Relying parties
   should perform their own validation of these objects in order to
   confirm the details provided in this RPKI LOA."

   All prefixes that are the subject of the RPKI LOA MUST be included.

   Each prefix MUST be clearly annotated with the origin ASN and also
   the provider ASN in the case where the origin AS is not the same as
   the provider AS.

   This section MAY include references tools that a reader might use in
   order to confirm the authorisations described in the document.  For
   example invocation syntax and example output from command-line tools
   might be included in order to make it easier for a reader to confirm
   the information described.

6.  Security Considerations

   LOAs do not provide strong authorisation because it is not
   straightforward to authenticate their contents.  Anecdotally, LOAs
   are often accepted by unqualified staff without systematic or
   thorough review.  It is not clear that the exchange of LOAs provides
   useful legal protection to any party in the event that a related
   subsequent complaint was made.

   The form of LOA described in this document does not in itself provide
   stronger authorisation; however, the contents do provide a means by
   which the recipient of a LOA can obtain a measure of authentication
   which is cryptographically strong.  The recipient of an RPKI LOA who
   reads and follows the directions within is able to obtain more
   confidence about the authorised use of IP addresses described within
   it than with a conventional LOA.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

Appendix A.  Letter of Agency

   A Letter of Agency (LOA) is a document used in telecommunications to
   authorise a provider to act on behalf of a customer.  LOAs were
   originally specified for use in the United States and their use is
   specified in the Code of Federal Regulations Title 47 / Chapter 1 /
   Subchapter B / Part 64 / Subpart K, "S 64.1130 Letter of agency form
   and content".

   LOAs were subsequently adopted more informally for use between
   Internet providers in order to document and authorise the use of IP
   addresses administered by a customer to be made reachable by an
   Internet Service Provider.  The acronym LOA is sometimes taken to
   mean "Letter of Authorisation" despite its original meaning.

   Dirk-Jan van Helmond tried valiantly to repair the authors'
   tremendously poor Dutch in Appendix B.2.  Any residual crimes against
   language are the fault of the authors alone.  Lucas Pardue's
